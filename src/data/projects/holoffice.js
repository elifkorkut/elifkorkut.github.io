      As a developer, I was responsible for building the technical foundation of the mixed-reality application on <b>HoloLens 2</b>. My work included implementing core multiplayer systems, co-location features, and user interactions using <b>Unity, MRTK, Photon, and Azure</b>. I collaborated with designers and researchers at Ericsson Research Center to translate conceptual prototypes into functional modules, ensuring the application supported both productivity tools and engaging collaborative experiences. I also optimized performance for mixed-reality devices and created custom Unity tools to support rapid prototyping and iteration.
