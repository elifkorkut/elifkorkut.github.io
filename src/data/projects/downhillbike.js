      summaryHtml: `
        <p>Tunnels is a VR horror game with single-player and multiplayer modes, focused on creating a tense, claustrophobic experience. Players can crawl, swim, climb, and zipline to explore the environment. Enemies react to light, sound, and movement, forcing players to adapt their strategies. In single-player, you follow a story through eerie tunnels, guided by cryptic clues and a mysterious voice on the radio. In multiplayer, players face changing maze-like levels and must cooperate to escape while avoiding monsters.</p>
