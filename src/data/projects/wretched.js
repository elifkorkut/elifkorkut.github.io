      summaryHtml: `
        <p>
Wretched is a highly immersive VR horror shooter that traps players in a nightmarish, blood-drenched hospital. Bound to a confined platform, players must survive waves of terrors using only a flashlight and a pistol. The game blends psychological horror with intense shooter mechanics, creating a tense and adrenaline-fueled experience.        </p>
